# cronos application.

This app has been created as a react learning exercise, but should be functional on local mode.
This was created using vite, react, MobX, MobXStateTree, and chakra UI
The goal of this app is to help you to measure your time. You need to start the timer of your current activity, stop it when you finish the activity. You can use the stop button, or tab in the current timer.

## features
* you can create, delete and rename timers.
* the timers are sorted by the most recent timer used.
* the current timer is updated each second.
* you can see the log of each used timer.
* the log is for just one day, the current day.
* you can install it as a PWA.
* the data is saved in the local storage.

## todo:
* Implement a sumary of the timers by date range.
* add the option to adjust the range for the log, for now you can see just the current day.
* the possibility to add, change, remove and rename boards.
* add pretty styles and icons.
* change the UI to be more useable.
* add the option to sign in, and sync boards, timers and the history between devices.
